	<h1>Hello!</h1>

		<p>I'm Andrea (the one on your right), and I'm a UI designer. Meet my little family.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a BA in Advertising. Most recently, I'm a graduate of the Iron Yard Academy's UI Design course and a current graduate student at Texas State University working towards my MFA in Communication Design. What can I say, I love to learn.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>I've always enjoyed making things with whatever I could find laying around. I love to make something out of nothing, and bonus points if I can find an excuse to use my powertools. The draw I've had towards making, coupled with my advertising background and an interest in understanding what people want and need, made the decision to jump into the design world an easy one.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I moved to Austin six years ago with my two cats in tow from the often underrated and beautiful Oklahoma. Here, I met my rockstar-turned-developer husband and we're currently excelling at living happily ever after.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Lately, I'm feeling more inspired and eager than ever. I'm working on my hand-lettering skills, spending lots of time with my buddies, Illustrator and Photoshop, and working on making my friendship with Javascript as solid as the one I have with HTML and CSS.</p>
