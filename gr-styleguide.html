			<p>
				Goodreads is a social site for readers and authors to find and share books that they love. With a Goodreads account, a user can build personal libraries with multiple shelves, track their reading progress, and find and recommend other titles to and from their friends.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Problems
			</h3>
			<p>
				The current Goodreads site is too cluttered. There is a lack of overall hierarchy which makes navigation confusing. With all of the site&#39;s features displayed, it&#39;s difficult for the user to tell what&#39;s the most important and where their attention should go first. There is no clear difference in type treatment for links. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Goals
			</h3>
			<p>
				Define hierarchy on all pages. Make the site easier to navigate. Reduce clutter.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Solution
			</h3>
			<p>
				Use color and font-sizes to define hierarchy. Use the Gestalt principles to group like elements together, making the site easier to navigate. Combine elements into dropdown menus.
			</p>

			<h4 id="grid">
				Grid
			</h4>
			<p>This project calls for a simple grid of one to two sections for easy navigation. In the small device grid, the single column layout allows for easy readability of dense content. In the medium and large devices, the layout shifts so that navigation options are in the 5 columns in the left section, with the majority of the content taking up the remaining seven columns on the right. All layouts are accompanied by an icon set in the footer for small devices and in near the header for the medium and large devices. All grids are designed with media queries for responsiveness.</p>

			<h4 id="colors">
				Colors
			</h4>
			<p>My plan for the redesign is to focus on user achievements. Users will have the opportunity to gain badges when they complete books, sign up for new challenges, create new shelves, or participate in a reading poll. This new focus requires a set of colors that reflect positivity, encouragement, and winning. I've chosen bright colors with high contrast to create an inviting and exciting site that will engage the users and result in continuous use, motivating them to update their reading status and move on to the next book.</p>
