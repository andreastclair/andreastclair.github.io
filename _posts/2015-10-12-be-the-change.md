excerpt: Design is people, and designing is helping to make peopleâ€™s lives better.

When I was a kid passing the time during summer vacation, I started a business rescuing animals from swimming pools. I got lots of spiders and grasshoppers, a few frogs, and even a salamander. I'd pull them out and do what I considered to be nursing them back to health until they were well enough to hop, fly or crawl away.  
<br>
Last summer I spent three months learning how to code in HTML and CSS. For our final project we had to design a website on any topic we wanted. I decided to design a website for buying, selling and renting second hand dance costumes with a portion of each sale benefiting dance scholarships for children. My site, [Second Position](http://stclair.design/second-position/), focuses on giving the gift of dance to children who wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to grace a stage.  
<br>
For the last few weeks, I've been working on a social issue campaign for another one of my MFA classes. Our assignment was to choose a social issue and create a campaign that spans across three different social media platforms. I chose the issue of incarcerated mothers and their relationships with their children while they're behind bars. I implemented my campaign on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and after an emotional day visiting a women's prison in Lockhart, I wrote a [blog post](http://stclair.design/2015/10/04/i-feel-important.html) about my experience.  
<br>
I've noticed that whenever I'm given an open-ended project I'm usually drawn towards designing something good for good's sake, and that in this profession, there are a lot of opportunities to do good through design and create work that solves social problems.  
<br>
The Chicago group [Greater Good Studio](http://www.greatergoodstudio.com/) is a firm who does just that. They focus on ideas that have a social impact and have worked on projects ranging from childhood obesity and early literacy, to bringing the arts to juvenile delinquents and designing Chicago's next transit app. Their small team of six is a diverse group of people with varying backgrounds, all on a mission to use problem-solving do good things together. They practice "human-centered design...design with the user in mind."   
<br>
While browsing the SEGD website, I stumbled across a [video](https://segd.org/george-aye-design-social-change) of co-founder George Aye. Aye speaks about a few of GGS's projects, one of which is a social project called Drive. Drive addresses the challenge of connecting the youth who are inside of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago with the arts organizations that are ready to receive them.  
<br>
There are classes inside of the detention center that help to cultivate and inspire the artists within these young men in hopes that this will provide an outlet for them and prevent recidivism. The issue isn't in the availability of the classes, but with their accessibility. These young men are usually in the center for about 30 days, so how can we enable them to stay connected with these groups and continue their art once they're released from jail? I think that it's important to note that when they were asked to describe what the Drive project was about, one of the young men wrote "Keep up with work." This research told GGS that these young men already self-identify as artists and they don't need a push to motivate them to create, but what they do need is a push to help them break down the barriers that prevent them from creating. Some of them would have to take a bus through a dangerous part of town to get to the center for classes, others have ankle monitors preventing them from leaving their homes. These factors resulted in the need to re-frame this idea from a physical connection to a digital connection.  
<br>
Thanks to their new digital approach, location was no longer an issue for those who have already been released. However, now they faced technical constraints - there's no Internet in jail. Again, thinking creatively, GGS created USB drives and put on them a completely self-contained website. Now accessible to both former and current inmates, this site provides the young men with a place to check out events, improve their craft and meet new people. It also contains other important resources for how to clear their records, get back into school, find a job, and other family support services. The main goal is to keep them from returning to jail.

GGS delivered 1000 USBs to the jail. On average, the jail distributes 150 drives each week, one for every boy released.  
<br>
Design for social issues started for George Aye when he realized that a sort of dichotomy was forming around the projects he was working on in his previous career. He used to use design to solve business problems. His example is that one week he might be asked to work on a design for Kool-Aid, essentially figuring out how to sell more sugary water. The next week, he might be asked to work on a project for insulin-delivering pens for diabetics. He figured out that he was working on one product that could lead customers to need to use another product and he asked himself: Is there a way where this compromise doesn't need to exist and instead everything you do is inherently good? Based on this reality, husband and wife team George and Sara Aye opened Greater Good Studio.  
<br>
Drive is just one of the many projects that GGS has worked on. Their team shares a passion for design in the social sector, and I hope that this theme catches on and becomes a common field in the design world. There are enough designers who would find this kind of work gratifying, and there are plenty of issues that could benefit from our attention. Probably the biggest hurdle in this work is the money - where is the funding going to come from? Grants won't last forever. How can we make this profitable long-term? I think GGS has probably figured this out, maybe one day they'll expand their operation to Central Texas and I can hop on their train of goodness!  
<br>
There is a great emphasis in our world on practicing design to solve business problems. That is, after all, what good design is all about. But sometimes these problems can be more abstract and we have to look at the bigger, social issue being presented. Design is people, and designing is helping to make people's lives better. George says, "Design is the tangible realization of intent." And the creativity required to make a project like Drive work is essential to making a positive, and potentially lasting, neighborly change. Founders of GGS, George and Sara Aye, believe that "research changes design, design changes behavior, and behavior changes the world."
