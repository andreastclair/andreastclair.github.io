There are so many restaurants in this town that it's impossible to enjoy them all. In a town where it seems like there is a new one popping up daily, one would have to have an incredible food budget to give each one a taste test. So how do we choose which ones we'll visit first? Word of mouth goes a long way, but the internet has the capability of reaching even further. That's why it's imperative that a restaurant have a killer website. Some of Austin's finest dining opportunities lack websites that reflect their unique style, excellent food, and local appeal. It's time to change that. 

I'm starting my mission of making the web a better place with Home Slice. This local pizza spot is colorful, inviting, and delicious. Although food can communicate a thousand words, we need a more appealing package so that the food has the chance to speak for itself. Which brings me to my menu redesign : a small step towards beautifying their entire site. Hopefully they'll like it and find it in their hearts to pay me in pizza.
