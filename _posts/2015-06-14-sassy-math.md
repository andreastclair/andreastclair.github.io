When I chose design as a career, one of the perks was that I would never have to do math again. WRONG. This week, I've had to clear out the cobwebs and get my algebra on in the form of @mixin(s). So far so good, but if they bring in calculus, I might run.   
<br>
@mixin grid ($col-num) {
  width: ($col * $col-num)+($gut * (($col-num)-1));
  margin-right: $gut;
  max-width: 100%;
}   
<br>
Due to the above, my brain is telling me it's done for the day. I hope that later my head will be clearer for more engaging posts. For now, I've squeezed out every last bit of brain juice and I'm in desperate need of a refuel.   
<br>
Goodnight World!
