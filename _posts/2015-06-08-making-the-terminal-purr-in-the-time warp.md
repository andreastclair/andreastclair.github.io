Time is flying by so quickly. When I'm coding, hours pass like minutes. I'm convinced that there's some unexplored time warp going on here, but everyone is too focused on their code to really notice. Or blink. Or eat. Or sleep. Or remember what day it is. We haven't stepped into design much yet, but I know that when we do, the hours will only get shorter. I can't wait! Who needs sleep when your mind won't turn off anyway, right? 

This week we also had to face one of my greatest fears-the terminal. I've purposely never touched that scary box because I just knew that with one wrong keystroke I could break my computer beyond repair. Sam made us face our fears head on. We were all a little bit weary, but we installed iTerm anyway and moved onward. Maybe it's the pretty themes in iTerm, dressing the fear in disguise, because in reality, the terminal isn't as scary as I thought. It should be called "the kitten" instead. 

Afterthought---everyone should name their terminal. I think I'll call her Hopper.
