Signs for the Homeless is a collaboration between artists Kenji Nakayama and Christopher Hope that started in 2013. Nakayama and Hope drew hand lettered signs for the homeless, recreating what was sharpied on the sides of cardboard boxes into carefully penned designs. Their goal was to give the homeless the power to be noticed.  
<br>
The signs we see at the corners of busy intersections don't stand out, are often difficult to read, and aren't given much consideration. But with these new, brightly colored signs, it's hard not to see the person leaning against the wall in the cluttered streets of downtown Boston.

Good design results in a desired outcome. Did they succeed at making the homeless more noticed, or did they make noticeable signs? If they did succeed, what is the result of making the homeless more noticed? And can one really make a positive impact by jazzing up their signs?  
<br>
These new signs could make the homeless more approachable to those passing by resulting in more panhandling money, but it doesn't seem to move beyond that. At the end of the day, the homeless are still homeless. They are still sleeping on cold concrete with hunger in their bellies. The most positive outcome to this experiment is the level of involvment that the homeless had in the creation of their new signs. They choose what the sign says, what colors are used, and some even have an idea of how they want it to look. This small venture into design is a breakaway from the day to day life of struggle and hopefully provides some positive outlet for them, even if only for a moment.

The problem, however, (one of many) is that these signs actually DO make them more noticeable. The homeless with these signs may become targets amongst the others in their community and the signs are quickly stolen. The lives of these people are so unpredictable that the signs are often lost or left behind, making the work that Nakayama and Hope spent their time on seem hopelessly disposable.

The social impact here may not be successful, but I applaud Nakayama and Hope for using what they have to try and make a difference. Many will criticize them for using the homeless as a means to get their own talents noticed in a world that is so full of great design already, maybe that's partially true. But they're still sharing what they know with a group of people that are too often overlooked. Let's focus on that instead.
