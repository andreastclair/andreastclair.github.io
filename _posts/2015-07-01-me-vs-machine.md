How am I supposed to blog when I'm so exhausted?   
<br>
_sips on 8th shot of espresso of the day_  
<br>
I've had a technologically exhausting week.   
<br>
**First** : I turned on my computer last Friday morning to discover that my entire projects folder had disappeared. Like it never even existed. There was no trace of it on my computer anywhere. My heart fell into the pit of my stomach with the weight of a ton of bricks. The only thing keeping me from thinking that the last five weeks of work weren't a dream was my repo on Github. Once I remembered that the last thing I did before I went to sleep the night before was push, tiny little Sebastian wings picked up my heart and put it back in its right place. That was way too close for comfort.  
<br>
**Then** : My computer threatened to fly away. The fans were blowing like crazy and it was hotter than a fur coat in Marfa on Memorial Day. You'd think that I was running Chrome + Spotify + the entire Creative Suite, but I wasn't running a damn thing. Yet another baffling computer moment. I made my way to the Genius Bar, worried that my less-than-a-month-old computer was a lemon and that I'd have to reinstall everything from the last few weeks (so much stuff). In less than 3 minutes, Genius Adam discovered that something strange was sucking up almost 800% of my CPU. The culprit : an HP printer driver. What the float?!

Wait a minute...bad things come in threes. Uh oh.
