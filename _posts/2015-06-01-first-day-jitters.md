This week, I started a new journey in my life. I became an official UI student at The Iron Yard. I was so excited for my first day of school. I set the countown app on my phone months before and had been watching the number slowly decrease from the triple digits, anxiously awaiting the day that I could walk out of my paper-pushing cubicle and never look back. 

Day one did not disappoint. After some brief introductions, our amazing instructor, Sam, had us jump in head first to the wonderful world of HTML and CSS. The subject-matter is challenging, to say the least, especially for someone whose only code-background is with the fancy customizations on Myspace over a decade ago. And although my brain is in an almost constant state of mush, it also feels like it's gotten the spark that it's needed for so long. I've spent way too many years in boring, unfulfilling office jobs, and now I'm finally in a place that challenges and excites me every second of every day.
I've made a few really great decisions in my life. This is most definitely one of them.
