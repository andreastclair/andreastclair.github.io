Last Friday I visited the Lockhart Women's Correctional Facility as a guest for graduation. The inmates participated in an eight week creative writing course put on by the incredible non-profit group, [Truth Be Told](http://www.truth-be-told.org/). These classes help the women process their past and seek to identify what happened in their lives that got them where they are now. This isn't about blaming anyone for their mistakes - it's about acknowledging their history, putting it down on paper, and allowing themselves to move forward.  
<br>
(Names have been changed to protect the privacy of the inmates)  
<br>
The other volunteers and I sat scattered throughout the gymnasium, leaving space between us so that the graduates could come and sit with us. There were about 16 of us and 13 of them. On my right, there was Amber, a young woman with perfect makeup who describes herself as loving, strong and kind. (Keep in mind, these women don't have regular access to beauty products, but every one of them spent their morning primping for this most important occasion.) Amber shared her role of tissue with me - she knew better than I that things were about to get emotional. To my left was Fiona, a woman who describes herself as strong and wants to share her newfound strength with others. Behind me was Collette, who was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by her high school class and has a cute, contagious personality that lights up a room.  
<br>
Once we were settled and the introductions were over, that's when things got real. One by one, the graduates stepped up to the microphone and shared the stories that they had written about themselves. They spoke of everything from neglect and physical abuse to drugs and death.  
<br>
One young woman was three years old when she lost her mother to the crack pipe. By the age of six, she was left raising her three younger siblings when mom moved to the streets. She spoke about becoming her daddy's new "wife" and suffering daily beatings. She gladly took the worst of the beatings so that her siblings, whom she calls her children, would be spared. Her father called her derogatory names and treated her like garbage. She said, "The only time I felt like daddy loved me was when he was between my legs." She got pregnant when she was 16 and she didn't know if the father was her boyfriend, her one night stand, or her own dad.   
<br>
Another told us how she was the daughter of her father's favorite whore - that her mom brought in the most money. When her dad died and her mom couldn't balance being a caretaker with a drug addiction, she and her little brother moved in with her aunt and uncle. There she spent years being raped by her uncle, forced into silence with threats that he would kill everyone she loved if she told. Eventually she decided that she didn't want to be afraid anymore. That's when she started dealing. She said she wanted to be tough and in control and wanted a way to escape the life that she was living. The only way she knew how to be the one in charge was to sell the stuff that seemed to control all of the adults around her. Her first customer at the age of 14 was her own mother.  
<br>
Another woman grew up listening to the moans and body-slapping of her mother's nightly guests. She grew up thinking that sex was the only way to show love and spent her years in promiscuity, looking for the man who would truly love her. That man ended up cooking meth and throwing the block of inventory in her lap when the police came.  
<br> 
Every story they told followed the same pattern : child of abuse who wants to escape, usually gets pregnant too young, turns to drugs, gets arrested.  
<br>
The stories were sad, dark and gut wrenching. They're the kind of stories that you need a shower after hearing. They're the kind of stories that make you angry. They're the kind of stories that remind you of how fortunate you are. They spoke of abuse starting before they were ten years old. They spoke of looking for love in all the wrong places because they had such a skewed idea of what love is. But they all spoke of loving their children more than anything else in the world, vowing to protect them and to never let them experience the pain that they had growing up.  
<br>
Out of the seven stories I heard, all seven women are in prison on drug related charges. One told her story of turning to drugs to try and block out the memory of losing her virginity years before she needed her first training bra. Others spoke of the easy money in drug dealing, relying on the income to provide a better life for their children than what they had. Some graduated with honors and just got mixed up with the wrong crowd.  
<br>
I can already hear the voices of controversy - How can I say that these women love their children when they still had drugs controlling their lives? I do realize that using and/or dealing drugs as a mom is wrong on so many levels, and that's not the way to take care of your children. Interestingly enough, these women seem to realize that now too. They'll be the first to tell you that they've made mistakes. I think I understand that they didn't make these choices because they were bad moms, I think they were really trying to be good moms. But I think that they were young and desperate - many of them were too young to file their own taxes before they had their first child.  
<br>
I'm lucky enough that I have never felt what they've felt, so I don't know what it's like to have to overcome something so evil. I can't honestly say what I would have done in their situations because I've never even been close to that reality. But I think the point of all of this is less about harping on their mistakes and more about getting in the right frame of mind to change past behavior so that they can be good moms to their kids now, in the present and in the future.  
<br>
It's probably important to point out that these women elected to take part in this class, and that not every woman who signed up completed the eight weeks. It's not easy to look into your past mistakes and evaluate what you've done and who you've hurt. It's not easy to forgive yourself. These women wanted to do this, these women want to be better.  
<br>
Once the stories were over, each graduate took their walk across the stage to receive their certificates. There were tears, smiles, laughter and hugs. We formed a circle and the volunteers had the chance to get on the mic and share their thoughts. Everyone thanked these women for their courage, their vulnerability and their honesty. They shared some of the most intimate details of their lives with total strangers as a part of their rehabilitation. I don't care who you are, that's hard!  
<br>
In the end, we went around the circle and everyone said their name and how they felt after what was a huge emotional outpour.  
<br>
I feel relieved.  
I feel drained.  
I feel thankful.  
I feel loved.  
I feel anxious.   
I feel strong.  
I feel at peace.   
I feel intrepid.  
I feel important.   
<br>
For some closing thoughts, I'd like to go off topic for a moment and just point out some truths: I DO think that there are better, more economical, more human ways of dealing with drug crimes that aren't incarceration. The United States has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners. The total incarcerated population in the U.S. is nearly 3 million â€” a 500% increase over the past 30 years. One in 28 American children has a parent behind bars. There are more people behind bars today for a drug offense than there were in 1980 for all offenses combined. The U.S. spent $80 billion on incarceration in 2010 alone. A first-time drug offense carries a sentence of 5-10 years. In other developed countries, that sentence would be six months of jail time, if any at all. Many ex-cons struggle to find work after they're released. Companies don't usually like to hire employees with criminal records and because they can't find work, ex-cons often go back to dealing drugs just to make ends meet.   
<br> 
Surely our country has evolved enough to realize that incarceration for non-violent, drug related crimes isn't the best method for rehabilitation. I'm not saying that these women should be excused for their crimes, just that there are more effective ways to help them handle their grief - ways that don't result in a criminal record. Collette has been in prison five different times on drug charges. She tried to go straight and find honest work after her fourth stint, but no one would hire her with her record. After months of searching, she went back to doing what she knew would put some money in her pockets. This time in prison, her fifth time, is when she was able to join Truth Be Told's class. There ought to be more programs in place, like this creative writing course, because these efforts are the ones really making a difference.
