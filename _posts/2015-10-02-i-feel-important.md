I feel relieved.  
I feel drained.  
I feel loved.  
I feel anxious.   
I feel strong.  
I feel at peace.   
I feel intrepid.  
I feel important.   
<br>
These were some of the feelings expressed yesterday when I visited the Lockhart Women's Correctional Facility as a guest for graduation. These women participated in 8 week creative writing and speaking courses put on by the incredible non-profit group, [Truth Be Told](http://www.truth-be-told.org/).  
<br>
These classes help the women think about their past and identify what happened in their lives to get them where they are now. This isn't about blaming anyone for their mistakes. It's about acknowledging their history, putting it down on paper, and allowing themselves to move forward.   
<br>
The other volunteers and I sat scattered in the audience, leaving space between us so that the graduates could come and sit with us. There were about 16 of us and 13 of them. On my right, there was Diana. A young woman with perfect makeup who described herself as loving, strong and kind. (Keep in mind, these women don't have regular access to beauty products, but every one of them spent their morning primping for the occasion.) Diana shared her role of tissue with me - she knew things were about to get emotional in that gymnasium. To my left was Yolanda, a woman who describes herself as strong and wants to share her newfound strength with others. Behind me was Georgette. Georgette was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" by her highschool class and has a cute, contagious personality that lights up a room.  
<br>
Once we were settled and the introductions were over, that's when things got real. One by one, the graduates stepped up to the microphone and shared the stories that they had written about themselves. They spoke of everything from neglect and physical abuse to drugs and death.  
<br>
One young woman said, "The only time I felt like daddy loved me was when he was between my legs." She was raising her three younger siblings at the age of six while mom was on the streets with a crack pipe. She talked of becoming her daddy's wife and taking all of the abuse so that her siblings, whom she calls her children, wouldn't have to. She got pregnant when she was 16 and she didn't know if the father was her boyfriend, her one night stand, or her own dad.  
<br>
Another told us how she was the daughter of her father's favorite whore - that her mom brought in the most money. When her dad died and her mom couldn't balance being a caretaker with a drug addiction, she and her little brother moved in with her aunt and uncle. There, she spent years being raped by her uncle, forced into silence with threats that he would kill everyone she loved if she told. Eventually, she decided that she didn't want to be afraid anymore. That's when she started dealing. She said she wanted to be tough and in control, that she wanted a way to escape the life she was living. The only way she knew how to be the one in charge was to sell the stuff that seemed to control all of the adults around her. Her first customer at the age of 14 was her own mother.  
<br>
Another woman grew up listening to the moans and body-slapping of her mother's nightly guests. She grew up thinking that sex was the only way to show love and spent her years in promescuity, looking for the man who would truly love her. That man ended up cooking meth and throwing the block of inventory in her lap when the cops came.  
<br> 
All of their stories were sad, dark, and gut wrenching. They're the kind of stories that you need a shower after hearing. They're the kind of stories that make you angry. They're the kind of stories that remind you of how lucky you are. They spoke of abuse starting before they were ten years old. They spoke of looking for love in all the wrong places because they had such a skewed idea of what love is. They all got pregnant way too young. But they all spoke of loving their children more than anything else in the world, vowing to protect them and never letting them experiene the pain that they had grown up knowing.  
<br>
All of these moms are in prison on drug related charges. Some turned to drugs to try and block out the memory of losing her virginity years before she needed her first training bra. Others spoke of the easy money in drug dealing, relying on the income to provide a better life for their children than what they had. Some graduated with honors and just got mixed up with the wrong crowd.  
<br>
I can already hear the voices of controversy - How can I say that these women love their children when they still had drugs controlling their lives? I do realize that using and/or dealing drugs as a mom is so wrong on so many levels, and that's not the way to take care of your children. But I also heard the stories of desperation and pain from these women, and I understand that they didn't make these choices because they were bad moms, they were trying in the only way they knew how.  
<br>
Once the stories were over, each graduate took their walk across the stage to receive their certificates. There were tears, smiles, laughter and hugs. We formed a circle and the volunteers had the chance to get on the mic and share their thoughts. Everyone thanked these women for their courage, their vulnerability, and their honesty. They shared some of the most intimate details of their lives with total strangers. I don't care who you are, that's hard!  
<br>
I'm so glad that organizations like Truth Be Told exist. With their help, these inmates are learning how to process their past and focus on their present and future.  
<br>
For some closing thoughts, I'd like to go off topic for a moment and just point out some truths: I DO think that there are better, more economical, more human ways of dealing with drug crimes that aren't incarceration. The United States has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners. The total incarcerated population in the U.S. is nearly 3 million â€” a 500% increase over the past 30 years. One in 28 American children has a parent behind bars. There are more people behind bars today for a drug offense than there were in 1980 for all offenses combined. The U.S. spent $80 billion on incarceration in 2010 alone. A first-time drug offense carries a sentence of 5-10 years. In other developed countries, that sentence would be six months of jail time, if any at all.
