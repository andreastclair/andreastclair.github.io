I love to read. And even if it means that my bag is a few pounds heavier, I love to read books on paper. Part of this is probably due to a bad case of library envy that I've had since I first saw Beauty and The Beast as a little girl - you know the one I'm talking about...

 There's something special about turning the pages and running your fingers over the words that you can't get reading on an iPad or a Kindle. There's something so gratifying about pinching the pages between your fingers to feel how far you have left until the end of the story. Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to run across a special edition - hard covered, artwork printed right on the book so you can feel the divets of the design, edges of the pages lined in some fancy metallic - it doesn't get much better than that!   
 <br>
 Now don't get me wrong, I love technology. A big chunk of my career ambitions rely on these glowing rectangles that we spend so much of our time staring at. But it's also a nice treat to write a letter by hand or turn the page of a book. It's nice to give your eyes a little break.

 I discovered a new (to me) kind of design recently when my husband brought home a graphic novel. I had never read a graphic novel, and if I'm being totally honest, I may have teased him a little about the fact that he still reads comic books at his age. (I learned, however, these are not comic books.) But, since he rarely steers me wrong and 99% of the time makes great suggestions (that 1% being when he got me to watch Big Trouble in Little China - it's no Roadhouse, ya'll), I decided to give this one a go. I'm so glad I did.  
 <br>
 The book he brought home was "Habibi", by Craig Thompson. "Habibi", (Arabic for “My Darling”) is set in a fictional Islamic landscape and tells the story of the relationship between friends Dodola and Zam, two escaped child slaves. Theirs is a story of tragedy, friendship, family and love. I am not writing a review of the book, I don't think I'm ready for that conversation, but rather an appreciation for the detailed artwork and carefully crafted designs found on all 672 pages.

Thompson's intricate designs flow through the pages of the book, swirling through clouds and smoke, wrapping around bodies and forming the delicate shapes of teardrops and strands of hair. He studied Arabic calligraphy and uses numerology and the intertwining of Biblical and Koranic vignettes as subplots with the main story. He created parallels between content, turning rivers into blood and turning chapter numbers into beautiful motifs.

Religion plays an important role in this story, and Thompson shares that in his artwork. There are many images of the characters looking to the sky for hope or guidance, with religious scripture written in the clouds. Often, the pictures do more talking than the dialogue.  
<br>
Thompson also spends a great deal of time writing Arabic letters, breaking down their construction and using the description of their forms as part of the story. The back of the book is filled with translations for these sections. Thompson has also posted a [gallery of his process](http://www.habibibook.com/process/) where you can look at multiple pages from lines on a page to completion.

"Habibi" is a beautiful book and one where I found myself following the swirls from page to page sometimes more than reading the story. But reader be warned, this story doesn't shy away from graphic imagery. It's one that, at times, can be so disturbing that you might still it see behind closed eyes. But it's a visually incredible book to read. So do yourself a favor, pick up this 5 pounder novel, and give your eyes a break.
