excerpt: Is design criticism interesting to anyone other than designers?
---

Is design criticism interesting to anyone other than designers? Everyone reads movie and book critiques â€” they're reading to find out if they should watch/read for themselves. But why would any non-designer be interested in reading about design criticism? I understand and respect that without critiques, it may be difficult to know what designs will stand the test of time and how we can grow and progress as individual designers. Do these critiques have a place outside of academia? 
<br> 
There has been a shift lately in that the general non-design public has become more vocal about design. Everyone has an opinion and a way to share that opinion with the world. These are not design-educated critiques, but I wonder, how much importance should we give to these general opinions? If, as designers, we are designing for the user, then should these opinions carry as much or more weight as those brought up by the professionals?  
<br>
As far as UI goes, we should always think of the user. Apple has done an excellent job of this, constantly improving the user experience. But when the general public has an opinion, for example, when [Spotify changed their green](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/06/15/its-just-a-color/) and people reacted, how seriously should we take things like this? The client doesn't always know best, and most of the time, people don't like change. The public's response to Google's new logo, however, was [neutral](http://fortune.com/2015/09/08/google-new-logo/). I wonder if this was frustrating for Google, considering how many hours they spent carefully and meticulously designing this.  
<br>
"Within both everyday user and design industry circles, the reaction (to Google) was more like a collective "meh". In today's combative and critical social media climate, this could be considered a win." (fortune.com)  
<br>
There was more opinion about the [Hillary logo](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/design-experts-trash-hillary-clintons-new-logo-117100).  
<br>
What makes people react to one design over another? How can people have such strong opinions about a shade of green, but neutrally accept a new logo that they'll likely see multiple times a day?  
<br>
Just some food for thought. Next up, design vs art.
