Dear jQuery,

Well, we did it. We went on our first date. I'm not sure how I feel about you. First impressions are really important to me, and you just came off as the most vague, sneaky and overly-complicated bully I've ever met. But then, you'd make me smile. Smile so big that I forgot how uncomfortable you'd just made me...until a few seconds later when you'd knock me down again. Why so cruel, jQuery? Why?

I realize that this is kind of heavy, especially after only one date, but I can't keep it in, jQuery. I need you to know. 

I'm big on first impressions, but we're all human (well, most of us anyway). I know that they aren't always the best representation of our character. We all get nerves, I get that. But I'm really trying here. I'm trying to love you. 

Your friends all talked you up. Everyone said that you were _so_ much fun. Maybe it's my fault for putting you on a pedestal. We spent the whole afternoon and evening together, and I feel like you got so much more of my soul than I got of yours. I shared with you my struggles and my fears, I spoke to you openly, I gave you my code to do with as you please, I let myself be totally vulnerable in your presence. And what did you do? You took the last slice of pizza.  

I don't want to spend my time with another "fixer-upper". Gone are the days where I'll tolerate being in a one-sided relationship. But I need you, and I'm woman enough to admit that. I don't want to sound desperate, but I'll hold no bitter resentment that you took that last slice of za if you'll just be my friend. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm just a girl, standing in front of a javascript library, asking it to click with her.

My dear jQuery, I want to love you, but right now, I kind of hate you. 

Love,
Andrea

P.S. Here's what I got from you tonight. I'm only partially satisfied, but I'm not opposed to second chances. Until next time, jQuery.
