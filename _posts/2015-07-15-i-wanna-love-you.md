Dear jQuery,    
<br>
Well, we did it. We went on our first date. I'm not sure how I feel about you. First impressions are really important to me, and you just came off as the most vague, sneaky and overly-complicated bully I've ever met. But then, you'd make me smile. Smile so big that I forgot how uncomfortable you'd just made me...until a few seconds later when you'd knock me down again. Why so cruel, jQuery? Why?  
<br>
I realize that this is kind of heavy, especially after only one date, but I can't keep it in, jQuery. I need you to know.   
<br>
I'm big on first impressions, but we're all human (well, most of us anyway). I know that they aren't always the best representation of our character. We all get nerves, I get that. But I'm really trying here. I'm trying to love you.   
<br>
Your friends all talked you up. Everyone said that you were _so_ much fun. Maybe it's my fault for putting you on a pedestal. We spent the whole afternoon and evening together, and I feel like you got so much more of my soul than I got of yours. I shared with you my struggles and my fears, I spoke to you openly, I gave you my code to do with as you please, I let myself be totally vulnerable in your presence. And what did you do? You took the last slice of pizza.    
<br>
I don't want to spend my time with another "fixer-upper". Gone are the days where I'll tolerate being in a one-sided relationship. But I need you, and I'm woman enough to admit that. I don't want to sound desperate, but I'll hold no bitter resentment that you took that last slice of za if you'll just be my friend. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm just a girl, standing in front of a javascript library, asking it to click with her.  
<br>
My dear jQuery, I want to love you, but right now, I kind of hate you.   
<br>
Love,  
	Andrea

P.S. Here's what I got from you tonight. I'm only partially satisfied, but I'm not opposed to second chances. Until next time, jQuery.   

<div class="horiz-line"></div>

This is for the Goodreads site redesign. When you click on a book in your shelf, the modal will pop up with a description of the book. Click "close" and it flips back to the cover. Voila!

These are tabs for the profile page of the Goodreads redesign. A user can switch between tabs to show the different sections of their page.

The stars...oh my. This is for the rating system on Goodreads so that users can rate the books that they've read. I managed to get one done, I will hopefully figure out how to get all the way to 5 stars on my second date with jQuery.
